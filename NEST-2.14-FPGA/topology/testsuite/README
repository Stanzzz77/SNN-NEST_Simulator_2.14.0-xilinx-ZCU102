Topology testsuite
------------------

conntests:
Execute 
  ./run_all_tests.sh <nest executable>

Should report that all results agree with results in reference directory
Testing free_mask_rect_12 will evoke an error message. This is intentional.

unittests:
Follow usual NEST unit testing setup, but need to be run manually at present as
<nest executable> <script name>

mpitests:
These are based on PyNest. Execute them by running

  ./run_mpi_tests.sh

The script should report identical files. It runs the same connection setups (once divergent, once convergent) on 4 VPs, distributed across 1, 2, and 4 MPI processes and ensures identical results.

The script then runs a regression test for ticket 516. If that test fails, NEST will hang.

../pynest/tests:
A Python testsuite for the py/topology interface.

Run as 
    python test_all.py
