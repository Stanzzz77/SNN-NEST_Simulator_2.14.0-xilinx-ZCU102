Name: testsuite::test_global_rng - check whether global rng gives consistent results

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_global_rng.sli -> compare results for different numbers of jobs 

Description:

The scripts test whether in simulations distributed over different numbers of 
processors the global random number generator gives identical results on all 
jobs and for different numbers of jobs.
See #186 for discussion.
