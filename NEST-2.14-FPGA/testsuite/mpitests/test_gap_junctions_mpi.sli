    Name: testsuite::test_gap_junctions_mpi - Test gap junction functionality in parallel

    Synopsis: (test_gap_junctions_mpi) run -> - 

    Description:
    test_gap_junctions_mpi.sli is an overall test of the hh_psc_alpha_gap model connected
    by gap_junction connection. The test checks if the gap junction functionality
    works in parallel.
