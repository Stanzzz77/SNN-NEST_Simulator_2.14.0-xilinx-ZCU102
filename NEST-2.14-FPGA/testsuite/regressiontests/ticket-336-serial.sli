Name: testsuite::ticket-336-serial - Check that vp-specific RNGs only provided for nodes with proxies

Synopsis: (ticket-336-serial) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
  This test ensures that GetVpRNG returns an error if called on a subnet or
  device without proxies. See mpitests/ticket-336.sli for a test checking
  correct vp-rng function.

 * Expects a GID as argument.
 * Returns a dictionary containing
 * - GID
 * - model of node
 * - VP of node
 * - if node is local: integer random number from VP-specific RNG
 * - local number of threads
 *
 * Determines number of local threads, model of GID, vp of GID
 * and tries to obtain the VP-specific RNG for the GID and draws
 * a random number from it.
 *
 * The test should fail on any node that has proxies, since they have no
 * well-defined VP and thus no well-defined VP-specific RNG (see r8824).
 *
 * When called on a node with proxies, one MPI process should report
 * a "full" node and a random number, all others a proxy node and no
 * random number.
