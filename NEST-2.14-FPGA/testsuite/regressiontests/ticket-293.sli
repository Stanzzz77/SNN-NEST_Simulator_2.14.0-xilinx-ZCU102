/*
 * Regression test for Ticket #293
 *
 * NEST crashed when a status dictionary passed to the root node contained
 * unknown keys, if the dictionary changed the number of threads.
 *
 * This test changes the number of threads and includes /foo in the 
 * dictionary. This must cause a SLI error complaining about the
 * "Unused dictionary item" foo, but must not crash NEST.
