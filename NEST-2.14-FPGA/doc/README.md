# `doc` folder

The documentation of NEST. This includes design documents and user documentation. The online help is generated during the [installation][install] of NEST and installed to the installation directory. We use [doxygen][doxygen] comments extensively throughout NEST. `make doc` will extract them from the source code and install the developer documentation into the doc directory.
